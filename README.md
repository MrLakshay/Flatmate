# flatmate

Searching a Flat and flatmate in cities like Bangalore can be a pain.

The main aim of this project is to get you a good RoomMate and a buddy.

This app is developed in Flutter.

This app have multiple screen which include Search Screen(Including filter), Profile and Edit Profile Screen, Add a new Request Screen.
Home screen and search result screen are yet to be implemented.

I tried generating code using chatgpt which came in real handy.

I have used Firebase to Login and SignUp the new user.

Other backend will be implemented using Firebase only.


Here are some screen:
